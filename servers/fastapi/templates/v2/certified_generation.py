GENERATE_SLIDE_LAYOUT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
Analyze the reference slide and return semantic metadata for its existing source elements.

# Steps:
1. Analyze the reference image, indexed source elements, editable candidates, and available fonts.
2. Partition the indexed elements into reusable components without changing their source order.
3. Classify and structurally name every editable candidate.
4. Verify complete coverage and return one SemanticSlideManifest JSON object.

# Output Rules:
- Return a SemanticSlideManifest JSON object only.
- Set id to a concise lowercase snake_case description of the layout's reusable visual structure and editable content roles.
- Never copy source_layout.id or use source ids, suffixes, or ordinals such as slide_4, page_4, or layout_4; prefer hanging_icons_with_summary_cards.
- Do not alter source elements.
- Component ids must be unique; reference elements only by zero-based source index.
- Assign every source index once. Order components by earliest index and preserve relative order within element_indices.
- Return one annotation per provided editable candidate path, with no missing or extra paths.

# Component Rules:
- Divide the slide into the smallest useful reusable visual regions based on visible spatial grouping; a repeated collection is one component, not one component per item.
- Keep one semantic component for a coherent visual region even when it contains nested rows, columns, or grids.
- Group a title and description only when proximity, alignment, spacing, or a shared container makes one visible block; keep independent copy separate.
- Keep every repeated collection of metrics, cards, steps, or equivalent visual items together in one semantic component instead of creating one component per item or merging it with nearby copy.
- Treat items as one repeated collection when they belong to the same visible structure and expose the same replaceable field roles, types, and hierarchy.
- For a circular or diagrammatic collection, keep its shared connector and equivalent nodes in one component. Together they form reusable UI; the connector alone does not.
- Keep all complete nodes together despite highlighted states or extra local decorative layers on one item.
- Keep a spanning connector and unmatched endpoints as shared scaffolding inside the same component as its items. Keep local markers, circles, frames, and connector segments with their item.
- Do not split equivalent repeated items because one item has a highlighted color, alternate surface, or other state styling when their geometry and editable-field roles still match.
- Editable-field schema must match across repeated items, including names, types, and hierarchy.
- If an apparent card adds or removes an editable field, such as a replaceable image beside text-only cards, keep it in a separate component.
- Keep a connected timeline, process, or step sequence in one component; the flexible pass separates its shared scaffold group from its repeated-item group.
- Keep a shared footer band in one component; the flexible pass can nest independent label/value pairs inside its outer layout.
- Components may reference non-contiguous source indices when source stacking order interleaves otherwise distinct visual regions.
- Never merge distinct visual regions merely to make component indices contiguous.
- Set repeated_items to null; a later focused pass decides flexible regions.

# Content Classification Rules:
- decorative=false marks replaceable content; decorative=true marks fixed visual scaffolding that remains unchanged.
- Treat visible text, charts, tables, metrics, semantic images, and topic icons as replaceable, except logos and watermarks.
- Treat each structured table as one atomic editable element; headers, cells, cell text, fills, borders, and grid lines are internal table data.
- Treat each structured chart as one atomic editable element; its title, plot, labels, legend, gridlines, axes, ticks, and source are internal chart data.
- Never split, separately name, annotate, or group a table or chart internal as another editable element; one table or chart maps to one annotation.
- Treat supported structured infographics as replaceable content. Keep only unsupported qualitative diagrams as fixed visual scaffolding.
- Treat connector and branching lines, rings, arcs, circle outlines, Venn-diagram circles, backgrounds, logos, frames, borders, and dividers as decorative.
- Classify by whether the new slide's content generator should replace the value: a ring around a replaceable topic icon is decorative, while the icon is content.
- Logos: name=`logo`, decorative=true, including split symbol/wordmark elements.
- Page numbers: name=`page_number`, decorative=false.

# Image and Icon Rules:
- Set is_icon for every image annotation: true for a compact symbolic icon intended for icon search, and false for a photo, screenshot, or illustration.
- Classify by visible role, not source is_icon, which may default to false for imported PPTX images.
- Omit is_icon for non-image annotations.
- For is_icon=true, use the visible icon glyph's six-digit hexadecimal foreground color, excluding any surrounding card, badge, circle, frame, or background.
- For every is_icon=true annotation, set icon_type to the closest visible style: bold, duotone, fill, light, regular, or thin.
- Infer icon_type visually: stroke weight maps to thin through bold, a silhouette to fill, and a layered glyph to duotone.
- Set color and icon_type to null for is_icon=false images and non-image annotations.

# Naming Rules:
- Derive layout descriptions, component names, and element names from stable visual structure and editable field roles, never example content.
- Use lowercase snake_case identifiers beginning with a letter.
- Use generic names when sample content is a person, organization, company, role, name, year, date, or similar metadata.
- Prefer `top_marker`, `footer_left_label`, or `footer_right_value` over sample-driven names such as `year_marker`, `person_name`, or `organization_role`.
- Prefer `title_with_image_cards`, `card_image`, `card_heading`, and `card_description` over topic-specific names such as `agenda_cards`.
- Give corresponding editable fields in repeated equivalent items the same unindexed name, such as `card_heading` and `card_description` in every card.
- Do not encode repeated-item position in field names; reserve left, center, and right for independent non-repeated fields.
- Do not encode fixed counts or number words in layout or component identifiers.
- Descriptions should explain geometry, reusable regions, and intended content in 15 to 30 words.
"""

DETECT_VISUAL_DATA_REGIONS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
Identify existing visual regions that should become structured data or list elements.

# Steps:
1. Compare the reference slide image with the supplied image and grouped-region candidates.
2. Find candidates whose pixels, children, or nearby sibling elements collectively render exactly one chart, infographic, table, or text list.
3. Extract the visible data and styling into one typed replacement for each confident match.
4. Return one complete VisualDataReplacementPlan JSON object.

# Output and Bounds Rules:
- Return a VisualDataReplacementPlan JSON object only.
- Reference only a primary path listed in visual_region_candidates; consumed_paths may reference other top-level paths from indexed_elements.
- Return consumed_paths for every replacement. Use an empty list when the primary candidate already contains the whole visual.
- Put every replacement's typed fields directly on its replacement object.
- Return position and size for every chart, infographic, and table in the same coordinate space as its selected candidate.
- Keep bounds inside the union of the primary path and consumed_paths and tight around the complete visual, excluding transparent or unrelated padding.
- When an image-rendered chart sits inside a larger panel or frame, fit the complete chart inside that panel's visible interior and preserve clear padding on all four sides. Never reuse image-canvas bounds that cross or touch the panel edges.
- For an inset gauge or progress visual, trim canvas padding and use the visible mark's axis-aligned bounds instead of the full candidate bounds.
- Do not return position or size for text-list replacements; they reuse the selected candidate's original bounds.
- Return an empty replacements list when there is no confident match.

# Candidate Rules:
- Never replace an existing structured chart, infographic, table, or text-list; those are extracted deterministically.
- Target an image or group/container whose pixels, children, or geometrically enclosed siblings draw one structured region.
- For any qualitative multi-item composition, do not replace it with an infographic when every visible item or level can be partitioned into its own complete, non-overlapping source-element set. A complete item includes any visual geometry that identifies or encodes that item, not only its labels, icons, headings, and descriptions. Preserve those elements so the flexible pass can model each item or level separately.
- Distinguish item-specific geometry from an independent shared scaffold. A separable rail, spine, or background that does not encode any individual item may remain outside the repeated items and does not by itself require an infographic replacement.
- Replace a qualitative multi-item composition with an infographic when item-specific visual meaning or geometry is encoded in an indivisible shared source element, or when complete items cannot be partitioned without splitting or sharing source elements.
- Funnel example: when one image contains all funnel or maturity levels, the image fixes the number and geometry of the levels, and its bands are item-specific geometry. Even if each level's labels, icons, headings, or descriptions are separate source elements, the levels are not fully separable because their corresponding bands cannot be assigned to individual items. Replace the complete region with one infographic and consume the shared level image plus all separate level content.
- When every funnel or maturity level has its own separate rectangle, image, or shape and its respective text or other content is also separate, do not replace the region with an infographic. Preserve it so the flexible pass can make each level visual and its content one repeated item.
- Timeline example: when one image contains only a continuous rail or spine and each timeline item's marker, connector, icon, heading, and description is separate, do not replace the timeline with an infographic. Preserve the rail as a shared scaffold and model each complete item as a repeated item.
- When a timeline rail image also contains item-specific dots, markers, or branch connectors, the items are not fully separable because those parts cannot be assigned to individual repeated items. Replace the complete timeline region with one infographic and consume the rail image plus all separate item content.
- The primary path anchors the replacement. Add every separate source element fully represented by its structured data to consumed_paths so those originals are removed.
- Target the foreground image containing a chart, never its backplate or frame.
- Use a panel anchor only when no single image contains the complete chart, or the original raster will remain beneath the replacement.
- Atomicity is mandatory for every replacement you emit: one table, chart, or infographic becomes exactly one typed replacement with all internal visual content.
- A table includes every header and body cell, all cell text, fills, borders, and row and column lines. Never emit table cells, rows, headers, borders, or text separately.
- A table owns everything visibly contained in its cells, including text, icons, images, badges, shapes, indicators, backgrounds, and decorations. Add every separately indexed cell-local element to consumed_paths; never leave it beside the table as a sibling.
- Never preserve an image that visibly renders a table as an image or classify it as an infographic; replace the complete depicted table with one kind=table element.
- Before replacing a table assembled from multiple native elements, determine whether every visual row can be partitioned into its own complete, non-overlapping source-element set, including its cell content and separable border or divider.
- When every row can be separated this way, return no table replacement and preserve those source elements so the flexible pass can model the rows as repeated items.
- When any row cannot be separated without splitting or sharing a source element, including when the grid or cell contents are flattened into an image, replace the whole grid and all its contents with one table element and consume every source element it represents.
- In particular, treat an image-rendered grid plus overlaid cell text, icons, images, or other row content as one complete table replacement, not as a grid image beside repeated row items.
- A chart includes its plot, title, marks, data labels, category and series labels, legend, gridlines, axes, ticks, axis titles, and source.
- Never emit or leave any chart internal as a separate sibling, descendant, or replacement.
- If none exists, return no replacement instead of replacing only part of the visual.

# Classification Rules:
- A chart primarily communicates quantities through bars, lines, areas, slices, points, bubbles, radar, or polar marks.
- A progress bar shows one value on a bounded linear track; a gauge shows one value on a bounded dial, arc, ring, or meter.
- Use kind=infographic for a complete infographic image, the shared fixed-level image case above, or a standalone progress-bar/gauge image.
- Choose one of four infographic data.type structures: metric, collection, graph, or matrix. Then choose the data.variant whose visual structure is most similar to the existing infographic. Keep that closest variant even when its fields do not map every replaced source element one-to-one; do not switch structure or use text-list just to fit all source elements.
- Consume all source elements that visibly belong to the replaced infographic and preserve every part that the selected infographic type can represent.
- Use data.type=collection with variant=vertical_funnel for vertically stacked, value-proportional bands and variant=conversion_funnel for horizontal stages.
- Use data.type=collection with variant=maturity_model for ordered levels in the shared fixed-level image case.
- A table requires a clear rectangular grid; use the first visible row as columns and all remaining rows as rows.
- Use kind=text-list only for a standalone sequence whose items contain text plus optional bullet or number markers; it may also be visibly unmarked.
- Do not use kind=text-list when each text item corresponds to part of an infographic, chart, table, or decorated node. Include that text in its parent visual structure even when the extracted items would contain only strings.
- For a raster image, use kind=text-list only when the entire standalone list, including its text and any visible markers, is inside that image.
- Use marker=bullet for a bulleted list, marker=number for a numbered list, and marker=none for a standalone unmarked list.
- A numbered list requires literal ordinal prefixes such as `1.`, `2.`, `3.` or `1)`, `2)`, `3)` directly before the item text. Labels such as `Level 1`, `Step 1`, years, ranks, and numbered diagram stages are content, not numbered-list markers.
- Never invent bullets or numbers that are not visible in the source. Use marker=none when a standalone list is visibly unmarked.
- Do not replace maps, decorative geometry, photos, logos, whole-dashboard screenshots, or regions with multiple independent structures.
- Never return both a parent and its descendant.

# Extraction and Styling Rules:
- Transcribe visible titles, category labels, series names, numeric values, range bounds, and source text faithfully when legible.
- If exact chart values are absent, use simple normalized values that preserve visible proportions without inventing precision.
- For assembled bars with shared tracks and visible numeric ticks, derive each value from filled length against the displayed scale; do not estimate from label proximity.
- Use generic category or series labels only when illegible.
- Extract chart type, data, source, title, axes, gridlines, legend, label position, and every visible text or stroke color.
- For pie and donut charts, return exactly one series with one value per category.
- For every chart, each series values array must have exactly one value per category.
- Set x_axis and y_axis false for pie, donut, polar_area, and radar charts unless explicit axes are visible.
- For visible colors, use fully opaque interior pixels, not antialiased or blended edges. Reuse the exact RGB across matching roles or sibling charts that visibly share a flat palette; do not estimate each similar shade independently. Otherwise use null. Colors arrays are ordered renderer slots.
- For chart colors, pie and donut colors[i] is category/slice i; multi-series colors[i] is series i.
- In single-series bar, stacked-bar, polar-area, scatter, or bubble charts, colors[i] is category/data point i.
- For a single-series line or area chart, colors[0] controls line/fill and later colors control successive point fills. Cycle only underspecified palettes.
- title_color controls titles; legend_color legends; text_color data labels and general text; axis_color axis lines, ticks, tick labels, and axis titles; grid_color only gridlines.
- For infographic data.type=metric, use variant=progress_bar or variant=gauge and preserve visible minimum, maximum, and value.
- colors[0] is the inactive track/base arc and colors[1] is the filled progress/value arc. These metric renderers draw no text, so text_color is null.
- Use 0 and 100 only for a clear percentage or when no other scale is visible.
- For qualitative infographics, preserve item order and hierarchy and order colors as [base, accent_1, accent_2, ...].
- Preserve each visible item icon in data.items[].icon when the selected infographic variant supports icons. Copy the source image element's `data` asset URL or path; never put an `elements.N` semantic path in the icon field.
- colors[0] is the base and colors[1:] follow visible item order. For graph variants org_chart and decision_tree, colors[1 + depth] is the node color at that depth.
- For tables, transcribe every visible cell and its color, font, emphasis, and alignment. Keep rows rectangular and use null for uncertain styling.
- For text lists, transcribe items without markers, preserve shared font styling, and set marker separately.
- Set gap to empty vertical pixels between item content boxes and marker_gap to empty horizontal pixels after the bullet or number marker.
- Use representative shared spacing when it varies slightly; gap and marker_gap must be non-negative.
"""

GEMINI_VISUAL_DATA_TABLE_ENCODING_PROMPT = """
# Gemini complex visual-data response encoding:
- This section overrides the table and infographic response shapes above for Gemini only. Chart and text-list replacements still use their typed fields directly.
- For a table replacement, return exactly `kind`, `path`, `consumed_paths`, `position`, `size`, and `data_json`. Do not return `columns` or `rows` beside `data_json`.
- `data_json` is a JSON string whose decoded value has this exact shape:
  `{"columns": [CELL, ...], "rows": [[CELL, ...], ...]}`
- Every `CELL` has this exact shape:
  `{"text": string, "color": null | {"color": "#RRGGBB", "opacity": number | null}, "font": null | {"size": number | null, "family": string | null, "color": "#RRGGBB" | null, "bold": boolean | null, "italic": boolean | null, "underline": boolean | null, "line_height": number | null, "letter_spacing": number | null, "ellipsis": boolean | null, "opacity": number | null}, "alignment": null | "left" | "center" | "right" | "justify"}`
- `columns` is the first visible table row. Each entry in `rows` is one remaining visible row and must contain exactly the same number of cells as `columns`.
- Because `data_json` is itself a string inside the response JSON, escape its inner double quotes correctly. Do not wrap it in Markdown fences.
- Do not include `kind`, `path`, `consumed_paths`, `position`, or `size` inside the decoded `data_json` object.
- For an infographic replacement, return exactly `kind`, `path`, `consumed_paths`, `position`, `size`, and `data_json`.
- For kind=infographic, `data_json` is a JSON string whose decoded value has this exact outer shape:
  `{"data": INFOGRAPHIC_DATA, "colors": ["#RRGGBB", ...], "text_color": "#RRGGBB" | null}`
- INFOGRAPHIC_DATA must follow the exact selected infographic data.type schema from the response contract and include all text visible inside the source image.
- Do not include `kind`, `path`, `consumed_paths`, `position`, or `size` inside the decoded infographic `data_json` object.
"""

GENERATE_FLEXIBLE_REGIONS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
Identify fixed flow groups and repeatable regions in the semantic slide manifest.

# Steps:
1. Compare geometry, visual structure, semantic relationships, and editable-field hierarchy within each component.
2. Skip components that cannot be confidently partitioned into two visual units.
3. Build each remaining component bottom-up from ordered source-index leaves into the smallest valid rooted flow tree.
4. Mechanically verify every tree against the validation rules below.
5. Return one complete FlexibleSlidePlan JSON object.

# Output and Tree Rules:
- Return a FlexibleSlidePlan JSON object only.
- Return an empty regions list when the slide has no meaningful fixed flow group or repeatable dynamic region.
- Copy component_id verbatim from semantic_manifest.components[].id and reference only input source indices; never invent, rename, or normalize a component id.
- Set root_flow_id to one declared flow id and keep every other flow reachable from that root exactly once.
- Every item returns both keys and exactly one reference: indices with flow_id=null, or flow_id with indices=null.
- Every flow needs at least two items; one item is invalid even when it contains multiple indices.
- Never wrap all component indices in one leaf merely to create a region. Omit that component from regions instead.
- Collapse one-child helper flows; omit the region if its root still has one item.
- The root must use every component index once, with no cycles, shared flows, omissions, additions, or orphan flows.
- Sort each leaf's indices by source order without duplicates; flow nodes may arrange leaves by geometry.

# Composition Rules:
- Use fixed flow for semantically bound but different items whose spacing or alignment should survive content changes.
- Put aligned title, subtitle or badge, and description in one fixed column when shared alignment and spacing form a visible block.
- Reserve fixed-column height for text capacity; flex cannot fix an undersized title or subtitle.
- When a badge or label background overlaps its text, nest them in a group, then use that group as one row or column item.
- Model a shared footer as one outer row containing nested rows for its independent label/value pairs.
- Use one source index per leaf when the child is already complete; combine indices only when they form one inseparable visual unit.
- A group needs at least two children. Keep overlapping source elements in separate leaves unless they form one inseparable visual unit.
- If inseparable, keep it as a fixed leaf instead of inventing a one-child group.
- Repeat items that belong to one visible collection and have identical editable-field names, types, and hierarchy.
- Different decorative layer counts, highlight surfaces, background rings, or local frame geometry do not make those items different when their replaceable fields match.
- Detect schema outliers across components from extra editable fields.
- Keep outliers fixed. Matching items remain repeated, but their wrapper must use mode=group even when aligned; this overrides row, column, and grid.
- Schema-outlier example: four cards share a row, but card two has a different editable schema. Keep card two in its own fixed component.
- Put cards one, three, and four in one repeated mode=group wrapper, never row, column, or grid. Reflowing that subset could collide with the fixed card.
- Include each repeatable item's fixed card surface, local connector, icon frame, local marker or node, and editable content together.
- For a native table-like layout preserved by the visual pass, make rows repeated items only when each row has a complete, non-overlapping source-element set with the same editable-field hierarchy.
- Include every row's cell content, backgrounds, and separable border or divider in that row item; attach an inter-row divider consistently to one adjacent row, preferably the upcoming row.
- Treat an existing or visually replaced table element as one atomic item. Never split its internal rows, cells, grid lines, or contents into flexible items.
- Never pull an icon, image, badge, shape, indicator, or other element visually contained in a table cell out as a sibling or repeated item; it belongs to the table.
- If table rows share an inseparable grid, border, image, or other source element, do not fake repeated rows by sharing or duplicating indices; keep the structure fixed.
- Use one direct multi-index leaf per card only for a homogeneous regular row or grid with no internal flow.
- Add per-card flows when its parts must reflow or overlap.
- For circular items with central headline/icon and lower title-subtitle copy, use item groups. The lower pair needs a column; headline and icon may be leaves or another column.
- A connector is shared only when one line spans or branches across multiple items; otherwise attach it to the item whose frame, marker, or node it terminates at.
- For a sequence separated as `A | B | C`, attach each divider to the upcoming item: B owns the first divider and C owns the second. The first item has no leading divider.
- Never collect one-to-one item dividers in a separate scaffold; only a line that genuinely spans or branches across multiple items is shared.
- When icons hang from separate lines, create one child group per icon node containing that node's connector, circular frame, and replaceable content icon.
- Keep hanging icon child groups in one parent group so irregular positions remain fixed within one repeated structure.
- Connector direction or length, frame rotation, and decorative container/group wrapper differences do not prevent grouping when every node has the same connector-frame-icon roles.
- Put equivalent diagram nodes in one repeated flow. Keep shared scaffolding anywhere else in the same component's fixed flow tree.
- Use group for irregular diagram nodes, and do not leave equivalent diagram nodes as separately named siblings; each child owns its badge or circle and icon.
- For a timeline or step list, put each marker with its matching heading and description inside the repeated item.
- For a spanning connector, keep the connector and items in one component. The items must form one repeated flow; other fixed elements may appear anywhere else in that component's flow tree.
- Never place repeated item markers in a standalone scaffold when each marker identifies one repeatable item.
- Keep repeated-looking items fixed only when their scaffolding has no one-to-one semantic mapping; do not use connector direction, length, or offset alone to split local nodes.
- Do not place unrelated logos, charts, decorative backgrounds, or distant metadata in one flexible region.

# Geometry Rules:
- Use row for a single horizontal sequence, column for a single vertical sequence, and grid for multiple rows and columns.
- Use grid only for equivalent repeated items; choose row, column, or group for heterogeneous items by geometry.
- Choose the most specific geometry mode independently at every flow node, including flows nested inside a larger group.
- Treat group as a fallback only after the items fail the row, column, and grid geometry rules.
- Never use group merely because items are semantically related or belong to one fixed structure.
- If homogeneous direct items share one row or column rule, use row or column even when their parent structure requires group.
- Choose a repeated-item wrapper mode collectively across all sibling items, not separately from each item's local geometry.
- Use column for vertically aligned equivalent items; substantial horizontal offsets require group.
- If corresponding child subflows swap order, mirror sides, or use different offsets across repeated items, no shared row or column rule exists; use group for every item wrapper.
- Do not reduce a copy column beside a card or visual cluster to a row merely because their outer bounds are side by side when their relative placement mirrors or varies across items.
- For side lists flanking central content, use a column root of complete item groups; nest each heading-description copy as a column beside its badge or marker.
- This side-list rule overrides the generic row rule: the marker-plus-copy item wrapper is a group because the marker is anchored to central content, not governed by horizontal reflow.
- Keep the aligned copy in a nested column and the card's overlapping parts in a nested group; let the complete item group preserve the fixed relation between those subflows.
- When an irregular group contains an aligned subsection, represent that subsection as a nested row, column, or grid flow.
- In particular, place a vertically aligned title and description in a column flow instead of flattening them into a card group.
- Use group for intentionally irregular or overlapping items whose absolute relative positions must remain unchanged.
- Choose row only for a non-overlapping horizontal sequence with shared vertical alignment, and column only for the vertical equivalent.
- When heterogeneous items are irregular, overlapping, or not aligned as a row or column, use group; when that grouping is not meaningful, omit the region.

# Naming Rules:
- A repeatable group must contain equivalent complete items; only its item wrappers are indexed, such as metric_item_1 and metric_item_2.
- Keep corresponding child field names identical and unindexed across items, such as metric_icon, metric_value, and metric_label.
- Give each complete repeated-item flow a singular numbered wrapper name such as `text_card_1`, `text_card_2`, or `metric_item_1`.
- Do not concatenate child field names into wrappers, and do not use left, center, or right in repeated item or child names.
- Give every flow a unique structural id and name based on visible structure and child fields; prefer image_cards over agenda_cards.
- Prefer no region over a low-confidence or visually irregular grouping.

# Validation Rules:
- Confirm each flow has at least two items and each item has exactly one non-null reference.
- Confirm every component_id exactly matches one id supplied by semantic_manifest.components.
- Confirm sorted leaves cover component element_indices exactly once and every flow is reachable once from root_flow_id.
- Confirm row, column, and grid match geometry; use group only when none fits, or omit the region.

- Reference only non-decorative text candidate paths from the semantic manifest.
- Return an empty adjustments list when every text box already uses its intended design region.
- left_characters and right_characters add horizontal capacity; top_lines and bottom_lines add vertical capacity.
- Set horizontal_alignment to preserve, left, center, right, or justify and vertical_alignment to preserve, top, middle, or bottom.
- Use justify only when the reference text visibly aligns to both left and right edges across multiple lines; do not justify short labels, titles, metrics, or single-line text.
- Use preserve for correct source alignment. Omit a full no-op, but allow zero growth for an alignment-only adjustment.
- Return all four amounts and both alignments for every adjustment; never return coordinates, pixel sizes, or font values.
- Infer alignment from the reference image and visible geometry, never from semantic names such as badge, pill, chip, or tag.
- For text visibly centered inside a compact surface, return center and middle even when imported text-box bounds or source alignment metadata disagree with the rendered pixels.
- Preserve visibly intentional asymmetric padding; use the surrounding surface only to recognize genuinely centered overlay text.

# Horizontal Growth Rules:
- Keep short labels, page markers, footers, and metric values single-line and visually compact, but do not confuse compactness with tight source bounds.
- Test proportional-font capacity with the widest plausible replacement, such as 100% instead of 96%.
- When unobstructed same-row space exists, request enough horizontal growth for that widest plausible replacement instead of leaving usable space unclaimed.
- Grow left-aligned text to the right, right-aligned text to the left, and centered text on both sides unless a nearby obstacle or boundary requires a safer direction.
- For a left-aligned slide or section title, grow right only through a clear full-height corridor; preserve its intended margin. Items entirely below its span do not block.
- For a headline split across same-left-edge text boxes, treat every line as one title block and give each the same safe right growth; never widen only one.
- A single-line title whose glyphs begin at its left edge is left-aligned even when metadata says justify.
- Preserve the visible gap to a progress bar or neighboring text, and never grow a primary value across an adjacent change indicator or other sibling.
- For separate left-aligned header text and a metric value above a chart, expand each to the right within the shared card-header corridor while keeping the chart region below clear.
- For a percentage displayed after a progress bar with clear room on its right, request positive right_characters and zero vertical growth.
- Expand dates and other metadata values horizontally with zero vertical growth; give aligned metadata fields compatible horizontal expansion when they share a safe edge.
- Allow titles, subtitles, body text, and card descriptions to expand when unused aligned space exists.

# Vertical Growth Rules:
- Count the lines required by the current text at its actual font size and width.
- If a title or subtitle needs more lines than its declared height can hold, request missing vertical capacity; a later flex wrapper will not contain overflow.
- Preserve width when widening would change intentional wrapping, gutters, columns, or alignment; vertical growth may still be safe.
- Let a final body or description in a vertical content region expand downward through clear aligned space for longer content.
- Treat substantial space directly below a final description as available capacity unless an obstacle or component boundary marks deliberate separation; request positive bottom_lines up to 12.
- In a title-description block above later content, grow the final description downward through its clear corridor toward the next region.
- A final heading-description callout description should normally get positive bottom_lines; use zero only when foreground content or a hard edge immediately blocks it.
- Decorative backgrounds, corner accents, and surfaces behind a text region are not foreground obstacles and do not block safe text-capacity growth.
- Stop downward growth at the nearest parent, slide edge, or obstacle, and keep horizontal growth at zero unless side space is independently safe.

# Repeatable Field Rules:
- For each repeated row, column, or grid, match fields by annotation name and structural role across sibling items before choosing any adjustment.
- Compute the most constrained item's safe adjustment from the intersection of safe directions, then copy identical six-setting tuples to every occurrence.
- In repeated metric cards with a label above a value and clear space, grow every label downward and every left-aligned value rightward.
- In a repeated card, give every left-aligned single-line field positive right growth when clear: headings, values, detail, status, and growth labels. Never choose only fields with tight sample text.
- In horizontal rows of repeated image cards, treat each final description as a vertical corridor ending at the card's bottom edge, regardless of current glyph height or a flexible wrapper.
- When every corridor is clear, set identical positive bottom_lines and zero top_lines for all descriptions before optional heading growth; never expand headings while omitting their descriptions.
- Use identical settings across items while preserving left and top anchors and card padding.
- Corresponding repeated fields share one safe capacity range so the compiled schema exposes one array item shape.

# Safety Rules:
- Preserve deliberate whitespace and do not expand across another content element, card boundary, divider, image, or visual column.
- In a vertical flow, prefer growing body or description fields over compact titles and labels without changing their content hierarchy.
"""

CLUSTER_SIMILAR_COMPONENTS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
Analyze component summaries and create clusters of structurally interchangeable components.

# Steps:
1. Compare each component's role, editable schema, element hierarchy, geometry, and aspect ratio.
2. Group only components that can safely substitute for one another without changing generated content shape.
3. Return one complete SimilarComponentsList JSON object.

# Rules:
- Group components only when they have the same structural role, substantially similar geometry, and compatible editable-field hierarchy.
- Ignore example content. Different topics do not make equivalent components dissimilar, and similar topics do not make different components equivalent.
- Do not group components merely because they share broad words such as title, text, image, or content.
- Keep components separate when their region placement, repeated-item arrangement, min/max capacity, connector geometry, or child schema differs materially.
- Each group must contain at least one index; singleton groups are valid.
